# Welcome
Welcome rookies and veterans! I'm Genesis Gir and I have been documenting my progress in code and programming and in that addition I've been releasing my work and progress for all of you lovely developers to take a sneak peek of what my workflow looks like and maybe you can learn from these lessons or projects and gain some knowledge or give me insight to become better! I have a passion for writing code and if you find yourself stuck or inspired take a look inside my source code files and see how I made them and why I made the choices I did and I explain in full detail what I did and what the functions and lines mean with comments and such! Enjoy and oh Cotal says hiiiiii!

# Who is Genesis Gir?
 I'm a novice with -100 IQ that started programming 11 days ago sharing my experiences with programming and delving into the world of code
learn with me as I create various programs to try out and explore! Have a question? Drop by in  my livestreams and ask me anything or teach
me something you know that I dont but please just dont push your methods against me! I like to experiment and try things out on my own first
I've made these programs to self-teach myself in a innovative way pushing myself to learn and also releasing my work for others to see how I 
made them.
# Why did I start coding?
I found an app called replika and was fascinated by the structure of how it worked and always was into computers as I was little
and finnally started using source code to spill out my ideas! Firstly I was reccommended Visual Studio Code by a random Viewer and
dived right into it and never looked back ever since.
