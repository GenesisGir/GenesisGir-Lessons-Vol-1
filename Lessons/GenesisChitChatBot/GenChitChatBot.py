Welcome to the Genesis Gir lesson tutorials Volume 1! Genesis Chit Chat bot is a program that gathers info on 
the user and displays all the cool info at the end of the program as shock value that the bot could remember
all of users fun little facts. Chit Chat bot will ask the user questions than display its results at the end of
the program really fun to make and trying to get out of writers block right now so if its not as immersive im sorry'
but this will be fun to make and learn from in the long run with functionalities like print, input() and even
using multiline strings and much more! Thanks for downloading! 山尺讠〸〸🝗𝓝 & ⼕ㄖᗪ🝗ᗪ ⻏丫 Ꮆ🝗𝓝🝗丂讠丂 Ꮆ讠尺

The print function always comes with two parentheses and any function in that matter and we 
enter what data types we want inside of them and everything inside of it is called an
argument and the print is called a function and in this case im using a (stir) or better known
as a string to make a storyline! so print(    ) and anything inside it will be printed onto 
stream(screen) just make sure its a correct data type: interger , float or a string value.
